          When doesn&rsquo;t Homer Simpson say what we&rsquo;re all thinking? The Internet won&rsquo;t go away. Computers are here to stay. So why not try to understand them? Instead of mindlessly scrolling through Pinterest, not even giving a second thought as to why you are being connected to the perfect recipe for chocolate lava cakes, perhaps its healthy to pause and think about how its happening. <em>How does it work? What is this Interweb that everyone keeps going on about? And what time does the grocery store close because I need to buy chocolate chips. (Seriously, though, these cakes need to be made post haste.)</em></p>

          I&rsquo;m a Copywriter. I&rsquo;ve flipped out like a surprised cat when seeing the words &ldquo;HTML.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve dropped my laptop like it was on fire when the words &ldquo;Javascript&rdquo; trickled their way onto the screen. It was time to see what&rsquo;s up. Instead of a black hole of confusion, I decided it was time to replace it with more of an undiscovered planet ripe for exploration. I&rsquo;d say at this point in my quest I&rsquo;ve penetrated the atmosphere&rsquo;s surface and can walk clumsily along the terrain, assuming I have the proper equipment and life support.

          Pretty good mission, right? RIGHT! It&rsquo;s great. To be in the company of other supportive women who want to better their skillset is something that cannot be undervalued. I knew a classroom setting would be essential for me to learn such a fish-out-of-water topic, and it makes all the difference to be taught in a targeted setting with caring, attentive instructors. So far, I&rsquo;ve gained exposure to HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT in the class - with more to come!

          My other learning life support? My husband, a professional Software Engineer who patiently answers all of my surely inane questions without the slightest hint of arrogance and never fails to encourage my pursuit.  (Thanks!)
